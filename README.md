The project explores in answering the 'what if' questions that cannot be answered using the observable data. In reality, there is focus on the observable causes of certain effects, but the hidden features are hard to be examined. Therefore, these questions in this project are answered by the causal graph which describes the relationship between the features.
# Data
In this project, Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Sets were used. The target variable is 'diagnosis' which tell if the cell is malignant or benign. Notebooks show the distribution and the visualization of the data. Features in the data are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
# Model
In this project, Bayesian Network model was used. The accuracy of the model was obtained to be 0.6. The causal_learning notebook shows the modelling and causal graphs created.
